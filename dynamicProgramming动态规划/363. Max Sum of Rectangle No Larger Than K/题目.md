这是一道hard题目，用到了Kadane算法（用来查找一个序列中连续最大的子序列，基于动态规划)，

题目如下：
Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k, find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.

```
Example:
Given matrix = [
  [1,  0, 1],
  [0, -2, 3]
]
k = 2
The answer is 2. Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2 and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
```

Note:
The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
